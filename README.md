# Networking Programming Project
For this assignment, you will work in teams to develop a network client-server application to play a game.  The game should be a multi-player game (two players is fine).  This should be a turn based game.  Board games, card games, pencil & paper type games are all possibilities.  Use of any language other than Python needs to be discussed with your teacher.

Note: This was a group project for the Networking Course.

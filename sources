  where is the main loop?
  need to draw new board outside of the loop
    import pygame
    pygame.init()
    win = pygame.display.set_mode((500, 500))
    pygame.display.set_caption("Connect Four")
    
  can just have a blue background and create the 42 squares, say of color grey
  a piece is "dropped" into the game board by changing the top colors (one at a time) to 
  turn into player color until collision with another placed piece.
